UTC: Time when experiment was performed
Temperature[C]: Temperature of surroundings, measured in celcius
Humidity[%]: Air humidity during the experiment
TVOC[ppb]: Total Volatile Organic Compounds, measured in ppb (parts per billion)
eCO2[ppm]: CO2 equivalent concentration, measured in ppm (parts per million)
Raw H2: The amount of Raw Hydrogen [Raw Molecular Hydrogen; not compensated (Bias, Temperature etc.)] present in surroundings
Raw Ethanol: The amount of Raw Ethanol present in surroundings
Pressure[hPa]: Air pressure, Measured in hPa
PM1.0: Paticulate matter of diameter less than 1.0 micrometer
PM2.5: Paticulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometer
NC0.5: Concentration of particulate matter of diameter less than 0.5 micrometer
NC1.0: Concentration of particulate matter of diameter less than 1.0 micrometer
NC2.5: Concentration of particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometer
CNT: Sample Count. Fire Alarm(Reality) If fire was present then value is 1 else it is 0
Fire Alarm: 1 means Positive and 0 means Not Positive
